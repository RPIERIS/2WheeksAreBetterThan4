# Udacity Project 2: Landing Page

## Aims

1. Give a real world scenario of manipulating the DOM
2. Appending dynamically added data to the DOM
3. Show how javascript can improve the usability of a static site

## Requirements

1. Build a multi-page landing Page
2. To circumvent not knowing how much content will be added to a page via a CMS or API dynamically add content to the page. This will be carried out via a navigation menu
3. Enhance user experience by actively differentiating the section being viewed by the user
4. When a user clicks on a navigation item the page will scroll to the appropriate section rather than a default jump
5. Refactor and test as much as possible

## Idea: 2WheelsAreBetterThan4

As a cycling enthusiast I am going to create a landing page for different types of bicycles that can be used. It will carry out the following

* Each section would be a different type of bicycle with a description of it and an image
* It will have a Nav bar horizontally at the top that will be fixed as the page scrolls
* The navbar will disappear if not in use once the user scrolls down and does not touch the screen. This will be after a delay of 2 seconds
* The nav bar will reference 6 bicycle types. Selecting each will take you to the relevant section by scrolling the page
* (Optional) When scrolled to the section the colour of the page will match that of the picture
* The icon to scroll up will appear as soon as the user selects an option on the page that is not the title section
* The scroll up icon will be disappear if the user does not interact with the screen
* When the user scrolls up it will do so gradually
* There will be a Credits section which will have details about me with links to my social media
