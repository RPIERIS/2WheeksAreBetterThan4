#Udacity Project 2: Landing Page

##Aims

1. Give a real world scenario of manipulating the DOM
2. Appending dynamically added data to the DOM
3. Show how javascript can improve the usability of a static site

##Requirements

1. Build a multi-page landing Page
2. To circumvent not knowing how much content will be added to a page via a CMS or API dynamically add content to the page. This will be carried out via a navigation menu
3. Enhance user experience by actively differentiating the section being viewed by the user
4. When a user clicks on a navigation item the page will scroll to the appropriate section rather than a default jump
5. Refactor and test as much as possible
