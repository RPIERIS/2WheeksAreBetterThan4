        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thecyclingexperts.co.uk/get-cycling/buying-a-bike/types-of-bicycle/road-racing-bike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cycling experts</a>
           the road bike is " is designed for going fast on smooth, paved roads. There are usually few concessions to comfort, and the position is long
           and low for aerodynamic benefits. Road bikes are built to be incredibly light but also stiff so that every bit of effort exerted by the rider
           shoots straight out of the back wheel."</p>
