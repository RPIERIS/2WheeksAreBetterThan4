             "the road bike is designed for going fast on smooth, paved roads. There are usually few concessions to comfort, and the position is long
             and low for aerodynamic benefits. Road bikes are built to be incredibly light but also stiff so that every bit of effort exerted by the rider
             shoots straight out of the back wheel."</p>

             the touring bike is "a traditional bicycle made to be loaded up and ridden long distances. Built from robust and repairable steel with wide-range drivetrains (usually with triple chainrings) that
             allow the rider to scale the most intimidating mountain pass even with 30kg of equipment and supplies attached to their bike."</p>

            the hybrid is "a very hazy term that covers an enormous variety of different styles of bike. Anything that falls between a road bike and a mountain bike is lumped into this diverse category."</p>

             Dirt Jump bikes "are designed to fly. Usually featuring 24 or 26 inch mountain bike wheels, and only the most robust frames and components, these bikes and their
             riders don't break a sweat catapulting themselves 30ft into the air."</p>

            "These fashionable, traditional bikes are all the rage on the continent. An incredibly laid-back position assures that almost anybody can ride one
            and load-carrying capabilities, built-in locking mechanisms and fully-enclosed drivetrains make them surprisingly practical around town. The weight, geometry and gear
            selection ensure that these bikes are not well suited to the hills, however."</p>
