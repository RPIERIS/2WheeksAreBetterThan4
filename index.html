        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thecyclingexperts.co.uk/get-cycling/buying-a-bike/types-of-bicycle/road-racing-bike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cycling experts</a>

           and low for aerodynamic benefits. Road bikes are built to be incredibly light but also stiff so that every bit of effort exerted by the rider
           shoots straight out of the back wheel."</p>
